# AntiRaid Docs

Welcome to the documentation site for **AntiRaid**, a highly customizable Discord bot focused on server protection, flexibility, and user empowerment. This site is built with Next.js and [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app), providing a modern, interactive experience for both users and developers.

## What is AntiRaid?

AntiRaid is not just another anti-raid or anti-nuke bot. It offers a unique approach to server protection by leveraging **structured templating** and a template shop, allowing you to tailor your server's defenses to your specific needs. Instead of a one-size-fits-all solution, AntiRaid empowers you to create, customize, and extend your own moderation and security workflows.

### Philosophy
- **Flexibility First:** Use Lua scripting for advanced templating and automation.
- **Custom Permissions:** Fine-tune who can use which commands and features, combining Discord permissions with [kittycat](https://github.com/InfinityBotList/kittycat) for granular control.
- **Transparency:** Open documentation and clear guides for both users and developers.

## Key Features
- **Structured Templating:** Personalize bot behavior, messages, and embeds using Lua.
- **Lockdowns:** Quickly restrict channels or roles during attacks, with multiple lockdown modes.
- **Backups:** Save and restore your server's structure, roles, channels, and more (see [Backups](https://docs.antiraid.xyz/docs/user/backups/README.md)).
- **Captcha:** Protect your server with advanced captcha verification.
- **Permission System:** Combine Discord and custom permissions for ultimate control.
