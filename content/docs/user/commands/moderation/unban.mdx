# Introduction

The unban command allows moderators to remove bans from users, allowing them to rejoin the server. This is useful when a ban was issued by mistake or when a banned user has appealed successfully.

# Usage

This command can be used by users with the **"moderation.unban"** permission by running `/moderation unban`

# Important Notes

- Unbans are logged in the server's moderation logs
- You need the user's ID to unban them
- Unbanning a user does not automatically reinvite them to the server
- Only permanently banned users need to be unbanned - temporary bans expire automatically
- The unban command will fail if the user isn't currently banned
- After unbanning, the user will need a new invite to rejoin the server
