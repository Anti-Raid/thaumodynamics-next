# Introduction

The restore backup command allows you to restore a previously created backup to your Discord server. This will recreate all backed-up server settings, roles, channels, and optionally messages based on the backup's contents.

# Usage

This command can be used by users with the **"backup.restore"** permission by running `/backups restore`

# Important Notes

- Make sure you have the necessary permissions in the server before attempting to restore
- If the backup is password protected, you'll need to provide the correct password
- Consider using the selective restore options (channels_only, roles_only, settings_only) if you only want to restore specific parts
- Be careful with the delete_channels and delete_roles options as they will remove existing server content
- Some elements like server boosting status and server-specific emoji may not be included in the backup
