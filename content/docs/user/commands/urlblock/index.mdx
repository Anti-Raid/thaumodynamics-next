# Introduction

The URL Block system provides powerful tools to prevent specific URLs from being shared in your server. This feature helps maintain a safe environment by blocking malicious, spam, or unwanted links before they can be posted.

When enabled, the system automatically scans messages for blocked URLs and takes action to prevent their distribution.

# Key Features

## Automated Protection
The URL Block system runs in real-time, scanning every message for blocked URLs and preventing them from being posted.

## Flexible Management
Add, remove, enable, or disable URL blocking with simple commands. Support for blocking multiple URLs at once using comma-separated lists.

## Comprehensive Logging
Every blocked URL is tracked with details including who blocked it, when it was blocked, and the reason for blocking.

## Smart URL Handling
The system automatically handles URLs with or without protocols (http://, https://), normalizing them for consistent blocking.

# How It Works

## Message Scanning
When URL blocking is enabled, every message sent in the server is automatically scanned for blocked URLs before it's posted.

## Instant Action
If a blocked URL is detected, the message is prevented from being sent, and the user is notified that the URL is blocked.

## Pattern Matching
The system checks against all blocked URL patterns, including exact matches and domain-level blocks.

# Common Use Cases

## Phishing Protection
Block known phishing domains to protect your community from scam attempts and credential theft.

## Spam Prevention
Prevent spam links from being shared repeatedly by blocking common spam domains.

## Content Control
Block URLs to inappropriate content, competing servers, or unwanted external resources.

## Malware Defense
Protect your server by blocking domains known to distribute malware or malicious software.

# Permission Requirements

All URL Block commands require specific permissions:

| Command | Required Permission |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Add | `urlblock.add` |
| Delete | `urlblock.delete` |
| Enable | `urlblock.enable` |
| Disable | `urlblock.disable` |
| List | `urlblock.list` |
