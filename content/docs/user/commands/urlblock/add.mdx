# Introduction

The add command allows moderators to block specific URLs from being shared in the server. Once a URL is blocked, any message containing that URL will be prevented from being posted, helping maintain a safe and controlled environment.

Multiple URLs can be blocked at once by providing a comma-separated list, making it easy to quickly block several malicious or unwanted domains.

# Usage

This command can be used by users with the **"urlblock.add"** permission by running `/urlblock add`

| **Status** | Confirmation that blocking is active |
| **Duplicates** | Note if any URLs were already blocked |

## Success Response

```

# Customization Options

<TypeTable
  type={{
    url: {
      description: "The URL(s) to block. Multiple URLs can be separated by commas",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
  }}
/>

# URL Format Examples

## Single URL
```
/urlblock add url:malicious-site.com
```

## Multiple URLs
```
/urlblock add url:spam.com, phishing.net, scam.org
```

## With Protocol
```
/urlblock add url:https://dangerous-site.com
```

## Without Protocol
The system automatically adds `https://` if no protocol is provided:
```
/urlblock add url:example.com
→ Blocks: https://example.com
```

# Steps to Block a URL

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Identify the URL
    Determine the exact URL or domain you want to block. Check for correct spelling and format.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Run the add command
    Use `/urlblock add url:example.com` or list multiple URLs separated by commas
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Provide context
    The system logs "Blocked at moderator request" - consider adding a note in your moderation channel
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify the block
    Use `/urlblock list` to confirm the URL appears in your blocked list
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Test if needed
    Optional: Test in a private channel that the URL is properly blocked
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Advanced Usage

## Blocking Multiple Domains
Block several related domains at once:
```
/urlblock add url:spam1.com, spam2.com, spam3.com
```

## Subdomain Blocking
Block specific subdomains:
```
/urlblock add url:malicious.example.com
```

## Different Protocols
Block both HTTP and HTTPS versions if needed:
```
/urlblock add url:http://bad-site.com, https://bad-site.com
```

# Important Notes

## URL Validation
- URLs **cannot contain spaces** - the command will fail if spaces are detected
- Malformed URLs will be rejected with an error message
- Each URL is validated before being added to the block list

## Duplicate Prevention
- URLs already in the block list will be skipped
- You'll receive feedback if any URLs were duplicates
- Only newly blocked URLs are confirmed in the response

## Automatic Normalization
- URLs without protocols automatically get `https://` added
- This ensures consistent blocking regardless of how users share links

## Immediate Effect
- Blocked URLs take effect immediately after adding
- The cache is updated automatically
- No server restart or delay required

## Record Keeping
Every blocked URL is logged with:
- The moderator who added it (your user ID)
- The timestamp when it was blocked
- The reason (defaults to "Blocked at moderator request")

# Common Use Cases

## Emergency Phishing Response
Quickly block phishing URLs that are being actively shared:
```
/urlblock add url:phishing-discord.com
```

## Bulk Spam Domain Block
Block multiple known spam domains at once:
```
/urlblock add url:spam1.com, spam2.com, spam3.com, spam4.com
```

## Competitor Link Prevention
Block links to competing communities or servers:
```
/urlblock add url:competitor-server.com
```

## Malware Protection
Block domains known to distribute malicious software:
```
/urlblock add url:malware-download-site.com
```

# Troubleshooting

## "Invalid URL" Error
**Problem**: Getting errors when trying to block a URL

**Solutions**:
- Remove all spaces from the URL
- Check for special characters that might cause issues
- Try adding the protocol explicitly (https://)
- Verify there are no typos in the URL

## "Already Blocked" Message
**Problem**: Trying to block a URL that's already blocked

**Solutions**:
- Use `/urlblock list` to see all blocked URLs
- Verify you're not trying to add a duplicate
- Check if a similar domain or subdomain is already blocked

## URLs Not Blocking After Adding
**Problem**: URLs still appearing in messages after blocking

**Solutions**:
- Verify URL blocking is enabled with `/urlblock enable`
- Check the exact URL format that's being shared
- Use `/urlblock listcached` to verify the cache is updated
- Ensure you blocked the correct URL format (with/without www, etc.)
