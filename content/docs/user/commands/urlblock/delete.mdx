# Introduction

The delete command allows moderators to unblock previously blocked URLs, restoring the ability for users to share those links in the server. This is useful when a URL was blocked in error, when a previously malicious domain is now safe, or when you simply want to allow a URL again.

Once unblocked, the URL can immediately be shared in messages without restriction.

# Usage

This command can be used by users with the **"urlblock.delete"** permission by running `/urlblock delete`

# Response

When a URL is successfully unblocked, you'll receive confirmation with the following information:

| Field | Description |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **URL** | The specific URL that was unblocked |
| **Status** | Confirmation that unblocking is complete |

## Success Response
```

The URL `malicious-site.com` has been unblocked.
```

## Not Blocked Response
```
❌ URL Not Blocked
The specified URL is not blocked right now and hence cannot be unblocked.

## No URL Specified Response
```
❌ No URL specified

# Important Notes

## Exact Match Required
- The URL must match **exactly** as it appears in the block list
- Format differences (http vs https, www vs non-www) matter
- Use `/urlblock list` to see the exact format that was blocked

## Immediate Effect
- Unblocked URLs become shareable immediately
- No delay or cache refresh needed
- Changes take effect in real-time across the server

## Cannot Unblock Non-Blocked URLs
- You can only unblock URLs that are currently blocked
- Attempting to unblock a URL that isn't blocked will show an error
- Check your blocked list first if you're unsure

## Single URL Only
- Unlike the add command, delete only accepts one URL at a time
- To unblock multiple URLs, run the command multiple times

## No Undo Warning
- Once unblocked, the URL can be shared immediately
- There is no confirmation prompt or undo option
- Consider if you want to re-block it later before unblocking

# Common Use Cases

## False Positive Correction
Unblock a legitimate URL that was blocked by mistake:
```
/urlblock delete url:legitimate-site.com
```

## Temporary Block Removal
Remove a temporary block after an issue is resolved:
```
/urlblock delete url:temporarily-compromised.com
```

## Policy Change
Unblock URLs that are now allowed under updated server policies:
```
/urlblock delete url:previously-banned-content.com
```

## Domain Recovery
Unblock a domain that was previously malicious but has been cleaned:
```
/urlblock delete url:recovered-domain.com
```

# Troubleshooting

## "URL Not Blocked" Error
**Problem**: Getting an error that the URL isn't blocked

**Solutions**:
- Use `/urlblock list` to check exact blocked URL formats
- Verify you're using the correct domain (check for typos)
- Check if you're using the right protocol (http/https)
- Ensure you're not including extra characters or spaces

## Wrong URL Format
**Problem**: Unable to unblock despite the URL being in the list

**Solutions**:
- Copy the URL exactly from `/urlblock list`
- Check for protocol differences (https:// vs http://)
- Verify subdomain matches (www vs non-www)
- Look for any trailing slashes or paths in the blocked version

## Unblock Not Taking Effect
**Problem**: URL still being blocked after unblocking

**Solutions**:
- Use `/urlblock listcached` to check if cache is updated
- Verify the URL was successfully removed with `/urlblock list`
- Check if a similar URL pattern is still blocked
- Ensure you unblocked the exact URL that matches the shared link

## Permission Issues
**Problem**: Cannot execute the unblock command

**Solutions**:
- Verify you have the `urlblock.delete` permission
- Contact a server administrator to grant the permission
- Check your role's permission settings
