# AFK System

AntiRaid provides a comprehensive AFK (Away From Keyboard) system that allows users to notify others when they are unavailable and automatically handles their return status.

## Quick Actions

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Set AFK Status"
    href="/docs/user/commands/afk/start-afk"
    icon="🔔"
  >
    Mark yourself as away with an optional reason
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Stop AFK Status"
    href="/docs/user/commands/afk/stop-afk"
    icon="↩️"
  >
    Stop you're on going AFK.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive AFK reasons to let others know when you might return
- Update your AFK reason if your away time changes
- Use the feature to prevent confusion when you're unavailable
