# Introduction

<Callout variant="warn" title="Important">
  Just adding AntiRaid (or any Discord bot) to your server will not do much
  unless you configure it first!
</Callout>

<Callout title="What is AntiRaid?">
  AntiRaid is a Discord bot that takes a very unique approach to protecting
  servers. Instead of providing a one-size-fits-all solution, AntiRaid uses{" "}
  <strong>structured templating</strong> and a (work in progress/coming soon){" "}
  <strong>template shop</strong> to let servers protect themselves in a way
  thatâ€™s tailored to their specific needs.

## Our Philosophy

While many bots like Wick provide a managed anti-raid/anti-nuke solution, these systems often provide suboptimal user experience to many servers as they may not cater to specific needs of the server.

<Callout>
  Wick, for example, is often criticized for limiting the abilities of server
  moderators in a way that makes moderation harder. While Wick is useful in many
  servers and does work quite well in the anti-raid/anti-nuke field from our
  experience, it may not be the best solution for all servers.
</Callout>

Templating, on the other hand, allows servers to tailor their needs directly without needing to go through the pain of making a custom Discord bot, hosting it, and then navigating the complexities of the Discord API manually while reinventing concepts like strings, punishments, permissions, captchas, and more.
