# Permissions

AntiRaid’s built-in commands use **Kittycat permission nodes** to control access. Below are the default permissions required for certain commands.

## Backups

- **`backup.view`** – Allows viewing and listing server backups (used by `/backups list`).
- **`backup.create`** – Allows creating and deleting backups (used by `/backups create` and `/backups delete`).
- **`backup.restore`** – Allows restoring a backup (used by `/backups restore`).
- **`backup.*`** – Allows all backup-related commands.

## Moderation

- **`moderation.ban`** – Allows using the ban command (used by `/moderation ban`).
- **`moderation.kick`** – Allows using the kick command (used by `/moderation kick`).
- **`moderation.unban`** – Allows using the unban command (used by `/moderation unban`).
- **`moderation.*`** – Allows using all moderation commands.

## Lockdown

- **`lockdown.*`** – Allows using all lockdown commands (used by `/lockdown`).

## Global

- **`global.*`** – Allows using all global commands.

These permissions are checked by AntiRaid in addition to any required **Discord permissions**.  
Most utility commands like `/whois`, `/remindme`, or `/afk` do not require special permission nodes.
