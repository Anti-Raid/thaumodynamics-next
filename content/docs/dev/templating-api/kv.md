# Functions

<div id="new"></div>

## new

Creates a new key-value executor with the desired executor scope and the desired kv scope

KV scopes allow for fast access to getting/setting/listing keys within a scope without needing expensive and potentially

heavily internally ratelimited operations like find() etc. as well as allowing for isolated

get/sets (as operations within one scope do not affect other scopes)

Note that the all keys are scoped. The default scope with the name `unscoped` is used when an explicit named

scope is not provided
