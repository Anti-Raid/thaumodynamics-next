## ScheduledExecExecutor

Allows templates to schedule executions of themselves with a specific id and data sometime

in the future

A scheduled execution is a task that is executed once at (or after) a specific time or interval.

When a scheduled execution errors, the caller should _not_ remove the scheduled execution

and should instead retry it at the next interval.

All scheduled executions have an ID and data associated with them for use by the caller.

may be slightly late.

Note that reusing the same ID may store both scheduled executions and will dispatch an

set of created scheduled executions with the same ID. While the number of elements in this set is

undefined, the set is guaranteed to not be the empty/null set

The ordering in which scheduled executions are triggered about a small time period is undefined.

It is recommended to use the `task` library for small time periods.
