title: Builtins Developer Docs
description: This folder documents built-in modules, types, and helpers available across the AntiRaid codebase. These builtins are available to templates, modules, and core services for common tasks and abstractions.
---

## Key Builtins

- **Types:** Common data types (User, Server, Channel, etc.) used throughout the system.
- **Helpers:** Utility functions for string manipulation, date/time, permissions, etc.
- **Template APIs:** Built-in APIs exposed to user templates (see templating-api docs).

## Usage

- Builtins are imported or available by default in most services and templates.
- Extend builtins by adding new types or helpers to this folder and registering them in the host service.

Builtins is a replacement for the old "bot" commands.
