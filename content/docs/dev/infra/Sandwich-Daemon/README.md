# Sandwich-Daemon Developer Docs

Sandwich-Daemon is the gateway manager for scalable Discord sharding in AntiRaid. It manages all Discord gateway connections, sharding, presence, and provides a unified API for the bot and other services.

## Key Features

- **Sharding:** Manages multiple Discord gateway shards for scalability.
- **Presence Management:** Handles bot presence and status updates.
- **WebSocket API:** Exposes a WebSocket API for internal services to interact with Discord.
- **OAuth2 Integration:** Supports Discord OAuth2 for user authentication.
- **Healthchecks:** Exposes `/antiraid/api/v9/gateway/bot` for monitoring.

## Configuration

- Configured via YAML file (`sandwich.yaml` or `sandwich.docker.yaml`).
- Supports environment variables for secrets and tokens.

## Extension Points

- Add new event handlers or integrations by extending the Sandwich-Daemon source code.

## Deployment
