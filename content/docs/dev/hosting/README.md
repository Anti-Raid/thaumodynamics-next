# AntiRaid Hosting Guide

Welcome to the AntiRaid hosting documentation! This section provides a comprehensive overview of all supported deployment methods for the AntiRaid (Splashtail) infrastructure, including both Docker-based and native (systemd) hosting.

---

## Overview

AntiRaid is a modular, production-grade Discord anti-raid and moderation system. It can be deployed using Docker Compose for ease and reproducibility, or natively on Linux servers using systemd for maximum control.

---

## Hosting Methods

### 1. Docker Compose Hosting

- Easiest and most reproducible way to deploy the full stack
- Orchestrates all services: bot, API, jobserver, template worker, database, object storage, proxies, and more
- See [`../docker-hosting.md`](../docker-hosting.md) for a detailed, project-specific guide

### 2. Native (Systemd) Hosting

- For advanced users who want to run each service as a native Linux process
- Provides fine-grained control, integration with systemd, and custom monitoring
- See [`../native-hosting.md`](../native-hosting.md) for a detailed, project-specific guide
