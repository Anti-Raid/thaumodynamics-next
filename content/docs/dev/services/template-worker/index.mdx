# Template Worker Service

The template-worker is a Rust-based microservice responsible for executing user-defined Lua/Luau templates in a secure, sandboxed environment. It provides the runtime infrastructure for AntiRaid's templating system, enabling users to customize bot behavior through Lua scripts.

## Overview

The template-worker service:

- **Executes Lua/Luau templates** in isolated, per-guild virtual machines (VMs)
- **Manages VM lifecycle** including creation, persistence, and cleanup
- **Handles template dispatching** and runs expiry tasks as needed
- **Enforces resource limits** (memory, execution time, stack size)
- **Provides sandboxing** to prevent malicious code execution
- **Exposes HTTP API** for template execution and management

## Repository

The template-worker service is maintained in a separate repository:

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/Anti-Raid/template-worker](https://github.com/Anti-Raid/template-worker)

## Key Features

### Template Execution

- Per-guild Lua(u) VM instances
- Persistent VM state across template executions
- Asynchronous event dispatching
- Resource limit enforcement

### HTTP API

The service exposes an HTTP API for:
- Template execution requests
- VM management operations
- Health checks and monitoring
- Expiry task management

All API types must be defined in `src/api/types.rs` or `src/events` and annotated with `#[derive(utoipa::ToSchema)]` for OpenAPI documentation.

### Expiry Tasks

The service runs expiry tasks as needed, handling:
- Key-value store expiration events
- Scheduled template executions
- Cleanup operations

## Architecture

The template-worker uses:

- **Rust** for the core service implementation
- **Luau** (Roblox Lua) for template execution
- **Khronos** runtime for Lua VM management
- **Tokio** for async runtime
- **Utoipa** for OpenAPI documentation

## Service Communication

The template-worker communicates with other services via:

- **HTTP/RPC protocols** for receiving template execution requests
- **Internal message queues** for event dispatching
- **Port 60000** (default) for HTTP API
