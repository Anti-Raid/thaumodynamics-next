# Luau Ecosystem Integration Notes

At AntiRaid, we believe that bot developers should be able to access the best tools available to them. To this end, we have integrated some popular Luau libraries into our templating environment to provide a more powerful and flexible experience while taking into account security and stability of the bot. Below, we outline the libraries that are currently available for use in your Lua templates:

## Lune

AntiRaid exposes large parts of Lune based on sandboxing constraints. See the below list for the available libraries available from Lune:

- [**@lune/datetime**](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/api-reference/datetime)
- [**@lune/regex**](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/api-reference/regex)
- [**@lune/serde**](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/api-reference/serde)
- [**@lune/roblox**](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/api-reference/roblox) (Note: only the roblox data types [here](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/roblox/4-api-status) can be found in AntiRaids version of `@lune/roblox`. The rest of the library is not available)

Roblox data types etc can be found in `@lune/roblox`. For example, you can make a Vector3 object like this:

```lua
local Vector3 = require('@lune/roblox').Vector3
```

We do not claim ownership of these libraries or their trademarks whatsoever, nor do we provide any guarantees or warranties regarding their functionality.
